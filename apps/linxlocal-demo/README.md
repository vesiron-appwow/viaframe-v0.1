# LinxLocal Demo App

This is a placeholder application built on the VIAFRAME chassis.

Purpose:
- Demonstrate VIAFRAME structure
- Act as the first demo target for LinxLocal
- Provide a safe starting point for future integration

Current status:
- No framework integration
- No routing
- No UI
- Structure only

This folder will later be connected to the active framework
(e.g. Astro) without modifying VIAFRAME core rules.
