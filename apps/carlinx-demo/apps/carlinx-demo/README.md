# CarLinx Demo

CarLinx is a structured vehicle-sale coordination app designed to manage
multi-stage buyer discovery without acting as a marketplace or transaction intermediary.

This demo exists to validate VIAFRAME’s ability to host complex, rule-driven app types
using metadata-only declarations.

No UI, payment handling, or negotiation logic is included at this stage.
